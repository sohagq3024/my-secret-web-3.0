Settings

Each menu opens a section for managing content or requests.

✔ Admin can accept/deny membership requests
✔ Admin can upload albums/videos
✔ Admin can set pricing

✅ 6. UI Design Requirements
Use logo-matching color scheme

Smooth, animated transitions

High-color gradients

Glassy button effects

Fully responsive (PC & mobile)

✅ 7. Logic Rules:
Without login: no paid content access

After registration: user chooses membership

After payment (fake): request sent to admin

Only approved users get access

Free products = no restriction

Use localStorage or dummy DB for now

🧠 Important for Replit AI:

Use components and pages folder structure

Use context or recoil for managing login/auth

Admin and User access should be separate
