Hi Replit AI 👋

Please upgrade and restructure the Admin Panel and entire data structure of “My Secret Web” according to the following detailed update plan.

✅ Admin Panel – Section-Wise Improvements (New Structure & Logic)
🔹 1. Dashboard Page
Add a table with daily stats:

Date

Total Profiles

Total Videos

Total Albums

Total Pictures

These numbers should automatically count based on database entries (simulated or localStorage).

🔹 2. Request Section
This handles membership request tracking.

Main Table:

Date

Viewer Name

Contact Number

Package Duration (3, 15, 30 days – show remaining time)

Action column with 3-dot menu:

View User Info (popup)

Delete User

Top-right button: All Requests

Opens popup showing all user requests (table format):

Date, User Name, Contact, Package, Accept / Reject buttons

On Accept → add to main table

On Reject → discard request

After expiration (duration over), request auto-removes from list.

🔹 3. Slideshow Section
Keep it as is, but replace “Image URL” field with:

File Upload field for image

Image preview display

Title, Subtitle, Order

Admin should only upload — no manual URL.

🔹 4. Profile Section
Each profile is a hub for albums, videos, and pictures.

Top-right: Add Profile (popup)

Profile Name

Date of Birth

Gender

Country

Upload Profile Picture

Submit button

Table:

Date

Profile Name

DOB

Country

Gender

Total Album, Pictures, Videos (linked count)

3-dot menu:

View Profile

Edit Profile

Delete Profile

🔹 5. Celebrity Section
This section should be removed.

Instead, homepage slideshow below will show public Profiles from Profile section.

🔹 6. Album Section → Rename as Content Management
Top-right button: Add Picture Album

Fields:

Album Name

Select Profile (dropdown from existing profiles)

Submit

Main Table:

Album Name

Under Profile

Picture Quantity

3-dot menu with:

Open → shows:

Album name

Profile name

Picture Table: Image, Picture name, Delete

Button: Add Picture (popup: image upload + description)

Frontend: Albums should display grouped under each profile.

🔹 7. Video Section
Top-right: Add Video

Fields:

Video Title

Select Profile (dropdown)

Upload Video (MP4)

Submit

Table:

Video Title

Profile Name

3-dot menu:

Open Video (show player + info)

Delete Video

Frontend: Videos should also group under respective profiles.

On video click: open video page showing:

Video

Description

Like/Comment (dummy)

🔹 8. Settings Section
No change right now (optional: admin credentials, pricing update)

✅ 🔄 Central System Logic
All content (Albums, Pictures, Videos) MUST be linked to a Profile.

User visiting profiles on frontend should see:

Profile Info

Tabs for Albums and Videos (only accessible based on access rules)

Admin panel should fully reflect this link and show totals under Profile.

✅ Tech Notes for You:
Use Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for layout

Use localStorage or simple fake DB for persistence

Use modals/popups (not full page) for all Add/Edit actions

Use clean table layout + icons for 3-dot action menus

Use date/time utilities to auto-calculate expiry, today’s date, etc.

📌 This is a complete backend-like restructure of the Admin Panel with a Profile-based content management system, and must replace the old flat structure.
Please apply all above steps and ensure everything works together seamlessly.

Thank you!
