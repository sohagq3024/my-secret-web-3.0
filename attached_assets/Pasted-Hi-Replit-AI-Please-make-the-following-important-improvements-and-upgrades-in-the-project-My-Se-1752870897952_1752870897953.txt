Hi Replit AI 👋

Please make the following important improvements and upgrades in the project "My Secret Web":

✅ 1. Remove Image & Video URL Fields – Use Upload System Instead
🔹 When adding or editing content (like slideshow, album, video, celebrity), remove any manual “Image URL” or “Video URL” fields.
🔹 Instead, use a proper file upload system for:

Image upload (JPEG/PNG)

Video upload (MP4)

🟩 Use a simulated upload handler (e.g., upload → store preview in local DB or local folder).

✅ 2. Album System Improvement
When user clicks an album, open a new page showing all images inside that album.

🔧 In Admin Dashboard → Albums section, please add the following features:

Album Title

Album Price → Dropdown with:

Free

150 BDT / 250 BDT / 500 BDT

$2 / $3 / $5

Thumbnail Upload

Add Contents button

When clicked, allow:

Multiple image upload (JPEG/PNG)

Each with description field

Allow at least 5–6 images per album

View button to see how content will appear

✅ 3. Video System Improvement
When user clicks a video, open a dedicated video page showing:

Video player (play uploaded MP4)

Video Description

Like, comment buttons (simulate only)

Price label (or FREE badge if applicable)

🔧 In Admin Dashboard → Videos section:

Upload video files (MP4)

Add thumbnail image

Video Title

Description

Price (dropdown like albums)

Save/Update/Delete options

✅ 4. Profile System for Admin & User
🔧 In Admin Panel → Profile Section, allow admin to create profiles with:

Profile Name

Date of Birth

Gender

Nationality

Description

Profile Picture (Upload)

✅ After creating a profile:

Admin can attach Albums and Videos to that profile

✅ 5. User Side Profile View (Frontend)
When any user visits a profile from Home/Celebrity page:

Show profile information (name, dob, etc.)

Tabs:

Albums → show albums uploaded under this profile

Videos → show videos from this profile

Users can view & buy based on access permission

✅ 6. General Instructions
Everything should be fully responsive.

Use Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI.

Use Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions.

Use localStorage or JSON server for data persistence.

Each Add/Edit form must use modal or drawer layout.

📌 Please complete these improvements. All content must be upload-based with proper preview and UI.
The whole system should be fully manageable by Admin without writing any URLs manually.

Thanks!
