Hi Replit AI 👋

Please update and improve my React project “My Secret Web” based on the instructions below:

🔧 1. Color Combination Fix:
Use a modern dark theme.

Background color: #0B1120 (Dark Navy).

Text and highlight color: #00FF99 or #10B981 (Neon/Emerald Green).

Buttons and navbar items should have hover effects and glowing shadows.

Ensure high contrast so all text is readable clearly.

🔧 2. Admin Panel Full Functionality:
Update each section in the Admin Panel to include Add, Edit, Delete options:

🟢 Dashboard:
Show total users, total requests, active members, and revenue.

Data should dynamically update from a local database or localStorage.

🟢 Requests:
Show pending membership requests.

Add Accept and Reject buttons.

Accepting should activate user membership.

Rejecting should remove the request.

🟢 Slideshow:
Show uploaded slideshow images.

Add “Add Image” button (upload URL, title).

Each image should have Edit and Delete buttons.

🟢 Celebrities:
Display celebrity list (name, role, price, image).

Add new celebrity.

Edit and delete existing ones.

🟢 Albums:
Show albums with price and thumbnail.

Add album with description, image, price.

Add option to mark album as free or paid.

Edit and delete functionality.

🟢 Videos:
Show all videos (title, thumbnail, price).

Add, edit, delete videos.

Option to set video as free or paid.

🟢 Settings:
Admin can update:

Membership pricing (BDT + USD)

Theme color

Slideshow timing

Optional: Change admin password

🔐 Admin Logic:
Use localStorage or mock JSON DB to store data.

Fetch data in each section.

Reflect updates immediately after any action.

Show success message after adding/editing/deleting (using react-toastify or any UI message component).

💎 Design Instructions:
Use Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components.

Use Framer Motion for smooth animations.

Add glow or soft hover transitions to buttons and cards.

Responsive on both mobile and desktop.

Please fix the site based on these instructions. Make it look high-end, clean, and fully manageable from the admin side.

Thanks!
