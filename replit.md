3. User session stored in localStorage
4. Role-based access control (user/admin)

### Content Access Flow
1. Content requires valid membership (except free items)
2. Membership validation on each protected request
3. Payment processing through membership requests
4. Admin approval workflow for membership activation

### Admin Operations
1. Dashboard with membership request management
2. Content management capabilities
3. User analytics and statistics
4. Approval/rejection workflow for subscriptions

## External Dependencies

### Database Integration
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend built with Vite to `/dist/public`
- Backend compiled with ESBuild to `/dist/index.js`
- Shared schema accessible to both frontend and backend

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL required for Drizzle connection
- Development vs production environment handling
- Static file serving in production

### Database Management
- Schema migrations in `/migrations` directory
- Push command for development schema updates
- PostgreSQL dialect with Neon serverless compatibility

### Recent Updates (July 18, 2025)
- **Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated from Replit Agent to Replit environment
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database configured with all required tables
- **Security Implementation**: Proper client/server separation with robust security practices
- **Authentication System**: Login system verified and working correctly
- **API Functionality**: All endpoints responding correctly with proper data flow

### Hosting Considerations
- Node.js runtime required for Express server
- Static file serving for React frontend
- Environment variable configuration for database connection
- Session storage with PostgreSQL backend
